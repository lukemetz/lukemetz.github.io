<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I am an AI researcher who is excited about bringing this technology into the world. In my free time, I play with robotics, programming languages, electronics, 3D printing, and graphics.</p>

<p>I was part of the initial team that built a “low-key research preview” product that became ChatGPT at OpenAI alongside John Schulman, Barret Zoph, Liam Fedus, and many others. Before that, I was a research scientist at Google Brain.</p>

<p> Right now, I am currently exploring something new.</p>

<p>Feel free to be in touch! Thanks for stopping by.</p>
